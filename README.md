### Tiny test example

Hiya 1776ers! Here's a tiny little app to show some test code as a start for our conversation.

#####Set up:
* Download repo. 
* Set up locally with ```bundle install```, then ```RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate db:seed```.
* Start up the ```rails server```.
* Run the tests with ```bundle exec rspec```. 

Looking forward to speaking with you!
